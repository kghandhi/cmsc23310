# This example shows a case where an acceptor (Acceptor 1)
# accepts a value, but it is possible for a majority of
# other acceptors to accept a different value.
#
# Basically, Proposer 1 proposes the value 42, which
# is accepted by Acceptor 1. However, before Acceptor 2 and 3
# receive the ACCEPT messages, both Proposer 1 and Acceptor 1
# fail.
# 
# Then, Proposer 2 (presumably detecting that no progress is being made)
# proposes the "null value" zero. However, since Acceptor 1
# has failed, knowledge of the previously accepted knowledge
# has been lost. However, this is fine, because a *majority*
# of acceptors has not yet accepted that value.
#
# The outcome will simply be that the "null value" will be
# agreed upon.
