# Example with two proposers and five acceptors.

# Same as paxos.quorums.1 but with Proposer 1 recovering.
# However, it gets stuck because it has only received
# one ACCEPTED message (which is actually a delayed message
# send before Proposer 1 failed) and two REJECTED messages,
# so it cannot conclude whether there is consensus (or
# whether the proposed value was rejected)
