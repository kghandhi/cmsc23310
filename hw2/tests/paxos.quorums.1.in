# Example with two proposers and five acceptors.
#
# Each proposer has a different 3-acceptor quorum (which,
# by definition, must have one acceptor in common)
#
# The system starts out with acceptors 4 and 5 in a failed state.
# Proposer 1 first obtains a majority for its proposed value (42)
# with acceptors 1, 2, 3. However, Proposer 1 fails before
# the ACCEPTED messages are delivered. 
#
# Then, acceptors 1 and 2 fail, but acceptors 4 and 5 come
# back online.
#
# Proposer 2 (presumably detecting that no progress is being made)
# proposes the "null value" zero. If no value had been accepted,
# then agreeing on the "null value" will have no effect on the
# system. If not, the previously agreed value will be used.
